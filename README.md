# Stock Flask
### Ongoing project

This is an front-end for my stock algos that can be viewed here: https://github.com/MioNok/Stock-algo

It's built on top of Flask with most of the functionality done. I can manage different users and it has some user specific such as watchlists and upvote tables. 

I still plan on revamping the home page, edit the algo pages to show the progress of the algo and the build an functioning API that can fetch the trade history of the algos.

The app is hosted on Google cloud and can be viewed here: https://stockfront.appspot.com/
